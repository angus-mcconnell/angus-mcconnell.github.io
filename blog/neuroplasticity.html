        <h2 class="sect-title">Neuroplasicity Changed My Life</h2>
        <p>Or more accurately it helped me to begin changing my life. This was a couple years ago. I was depressed, I had been for quite some time, and I was seeing a therapist to help me with this. At this point we'd managed to figure that a key point of my depression was rooted in traumatic guilt.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To help me to understand how that trauma had such a power over me, and how we can work to overcome it, she introduced me to the idea of Neuroplasticity. The scientific concept that the human mind is capable of change and growth.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Basically when the mind experiences something new that causes neurons to forge new links. If the mind experiences this again those links become reinforced, stronger. And if these links aren't used then the connections begin to atrophy and fade away. Your brain is muscle, is the immediate take away, if you exercise makes it stronger.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>But there's a little more to it than that. First is that as far as your brain is concerned there isn't a great deal of difference between imagining experiencing a thing and actually experiencing a thing. If you imagine doing a thing that makes you happy, it will help to make you feel happy, and it will help to reinforce those neural pathways. Second this applies to all experiences positive and negative.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>From this I came to understand that every time I dwelt on my guilt it was like I was experiencing it again, reinforcing those  neural pathways and making it stronger. And I also understood that, with intent, I could weaken that neural circuit and build healthier ones to create a more positive outlook on life.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sect-title">How To Take Advantage of Your Plastic Mind</h2>
        <p>Recognising and understanding that you are capable of growth and change is the first step towards that growth and change. So the first trick is understanding the what and how of Neuroplasticity. Simple enough.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Then you've got visualisation. Like I said imagining a thing can be almost as good as doing a thing when it comes to forming new neural pathways. This isn't a new idea, think to any kung-fu or sports film and it's probably got a scene where the teacher explains to the student that they need to imagine the swing, or the strike, or the kick, or whatever the action maybe in their minds eye. Practically this means meditation, if you focus your thoughts on doing a thing and succeeding at it, you'll be in a better mindset to achieve those goals.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Just as important as cultivating positive ideas is avoiding negative ones. Negativity reinforces connections just as well as positivity. Developing ways to circumvent, or diminish thoughts about failure or embarrassment is if not key, at least extraordinarily helpful. The less you engage with such thoughts the weaker they become.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>An extension of visualisation is practice and confidence. As good as visualisation actual practice is better, and feeling confident about your self will make you more enthusiastic practice. But confidence can't be faked, and practice can be daunting, so cheat a little bit. Start small, set achievable goals, and focus on your successes. Doing this will allow you to build up confidence over time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>But really the best way to take advantage of Neuroplasticity is by cultivating a Growth Mindset.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sect-title">Growth Mindset; Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Challenge</h2>
        <p>The idea of a growth mindset exists in opposition to the idea of a fixed mindset. A fixed mindset sees a persons intelligence, talents, and traits as fixed things, innate and immutable. Alternatively a growth mindset recognises that all of these things can be changed. A growth mindset rests on the idea that we are capable of growth and change, that none of our attributes are fixed. Sound familiar to what we were talking about with Neuroplasticity?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Key to the idea of a growth mindset is how you relate to the idea of being challenged. A fixed mindset will often respond to finding a task challenging with despair, insecurity and defensive behaviour. If you don't believe that you can better than you already are then being confronted by your limitations is a distinctly negative experience. With a growth mindset your perspective on challenges changes. No longer is difficulty a painful reminder of your limitations but a signal of what you have yet to learn.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Having a growth mindset inspires resilience, and inspires a belief that you can better your self. So how do we get one? Well the steps talked about earlier are certainly a good place to start, and starting a mantra about "failure being the first step on the road to success" can't hurt, but we can get more specific than that:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>When we fail it's important to recognise where we have still succeeded. Maybe there are things that we've learned in the process, new skills that we developed, new relationships we formed. Rarely is a failure ever a complete waste of ones effort, and even if it was, you can always use it as an experience to learn from. Sometimes just trying a new thing is a bigger deal than whether we succeeded or failed.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Just as important is praising your self for your successes, and recognising all of the work that went into it. The difficulties you encountered along the way, and how overcoming them helped you to get where you are now.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Learn to recognise your fixed mindset triggers. Having a growth mindset is never going to be an all encompassing thing, everyone has areas where they will be inclined to growth and areas where they are inclined to staying fixed. If you can recognise when you respond to challenges with a fixed response, like "I'm not good at art" or "I can't dance", then overtime you'll be able to respond to these responses. The response should always be "not yet, but soon I will".
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="sect-title">What I'm Going to Do About It</h2>
        <p>Neuroplasticity and growth mindsets are concepts that I had already been introduced to (though with growth mindsets it wasn't by that name). They are lessons that I have been trying to intergrate into my life and psyche for well over a year now. But exploring them in detail has certainly helped to further my understanding of the processes under which they work.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I mentioned in my learning plan that my biggest weakness is a fear of failure. Continuing to develop a growth mindset is going to be key to overcoming that. And key to developing that mindset is going to be developing confidence, not so much in any single or set of skills, but in the process of developing any skill in general. Also key is going to be the ongoing battle with quieting the voice that says "I can't" and shouting back "NOT YET, BUT SOON I WILL!"</p>
