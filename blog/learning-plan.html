          This revision (1.1) of my learning plan has occured at the end of Foundation, before we start Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sect-title">Long Term Goals</h2>
        <p>
          For now this remains mostly unchanged. Long term planning still remains a weakness of mine and I hope to begin having some answers to this question as I progress through Bootcamp. A little note of positivity, I'm beginning to suspect that a friend of mine who works adjacent to the Web Dev team in her company is planning to try and get me to joint them.

        <h2 class="sect-title">Learning Strengths & Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          Foundations has been great for boosting my confidence. Turns out that, at least so far, I've got a bit of a talent for coding. I've found that working through the Javascript exercises has been a pleasant and rewarding experience. I don't expect Bootcamp to be a walk in the park, but I do hope that I can continue to leverage this new found aptitude.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Going into Bootcamp my biggest apprehension is definitely around my natural tendency towards introversion. Particularly if Auckland continues to remain in level 3 (or higher), I'm not great at forming new relationships with others at the best of times, adding the extra requirement of doing so with out in person interactions certainly isn't going to make it easier.

        h2 class="sect-title">Non-Technical Skills I Want to Develop</h2>
        <p>
          Looking at what I just talked about in the previous section, and what I talked about in the first Learning Plan, it's safe to say that I am continuing my focus on developing my communication behaviour. It's still an area that I am feel is a great weakness for my self. But I have been working at it already during Foundations, I've made an effort to be present in the slack discussions, and have been open to asking others for help or offering help to others when they need it.

        <p>
          My commitement to finishing this course remains the same.

        <h2 class="sect-title">Long Term Goals</h2>
        <p>Long term planning is not my greatest strength. When I start thinking to large in scope I begin to get sucked into a combination of perfectionism and pessimism. When this happens it becomes a struggle for me to act. That said I am commited to finishing this course, using the skills gained to get a foothold in the tech industry, and from there finding a career path that would give me a degree of freedom to travel. At least for a short while.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sect-title">Learning Strengths and Limitations</h2>
        <p>The biggest challenges that I have ahead of me in this course are my fear of failure and my perfectionism. When starting a task it is important for me to focus on the first steps least I begin to obsess on the project as whole and begin to feel overwhelmed. And setting reasonable time frames to complete different components to a task can help prevent me from getting overly obsessed on miniscule details. The timeboxes in the foundations coursework have been a great help in developing this.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The good news is that once I get started on a task that I can find my flow quite easily. I find my self to be detail oriented and adaptive to unexpeced issues. Where I certainly need to improve is in seeking help from others, particularly when feeling overwhelmed as already mentioned. I've worked hard to foster a support network of friends and family that I can reach out to when this happend. But I need to do the same with reaching out to faculty staff and fellow students.</p>
        <h2 class="sect-title">Non-Technical Skills I Want to Develop</h2>
        <p>I am very much and introvert by nature, unfamiliar social situations are about as far out of my confort zone as I can get. I see this course as an opportunity to dvelop what is a very unfamiliar skill. As such I am determined that by the end of foundations to have made the effort to have made connections with as many of the students in the Auckland campus. The lockdown Auckland is currently in has made this a bit more difficult than expected. But even if it doesn't end soon I hope to persevere.</p>
        <h2 class="sect-title">My Commitment to Completing This Programme</h2>
        <p>This is not actually my first time attending this course. The first time I quickly got overwhelmed both by the course work and my fear of failure. It was far from my proudest moment. Fortunately I have been granted a second opportunity, this is not something I have taken lightly. I have worked hard to identify why it was I failed the first time, and what I could do to improve.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have acknowledged how overpowering my fear of failure can be, and worked to develop meditation practices to help relieve it. I am commited to communicating with my course facillitator and fellow students so I don't allow my self to become isolated. Every week I am taking note of what practices helped me to finish my course work in a timely manner and which didn't. I don't have all the answers yet but everyday I am learning and getting better. Recently I discovered that caffeine in the morning is not my friend, and that am better motivated by reminding my self that this is something I want to do, instead of framing it as something I need to do.</p>
