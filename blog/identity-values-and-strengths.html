        <ul class="list">
          <li>We all owe a basic responsibility to care for and respect the well being of ourselves, each other, our society, and our shared environment.</li>
          <li>Everyone has different experiences, all of these experiences are valid. Everyone has something to offer, everyone has things to learn.</li>
          <li>Changing your mind does not make you a hypocrite, it shows you are capable of growth.</li>
          <li>Emotional intelligence and rational intelligence are both valuable tools necessary to growth and understanding. One must always temper one with the other, neither is superior.</li>
          <li>In the modern information age one responsibility we all share is in the development of critical thinking, and its application to our media landscape.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="sect-title">An Ethical Dilema</h2>
        <p>I was good friends with a couple in relationship. I cared for both of them as individuals, not valuing one over the other. In many ways they suited each other as partners very well, enjoying the time they spent together, had shared similar interests, and treated each other with respect. It was easy for the two of them, and all of their friends, to imagine that they would be able to go the distance.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However over time it became clear that their relationship had hit a wall. As individuals they both had areas they they needed to grow in. And although they could see this in the other, neither was willing to acknowledge it in their selves. Compounding this problem was the fact that neither of them had learned healthy ways of communicating issues like this.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To me it was clear what the issues were, that it would take a lot of hard work and painful growth for them to resolve their issues, and I believed it to be possible. But if neither of them was willing to make those changes then it was time let the relationship end before any more hurt is inflicted.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Rarely would either talk about this with me directly. But on occasion the topic would be approached from the side making it difficult to speak about it clearly. When this occured it felt like walking a tightrope of obligations, I didn't want to be responsible for the end of this relationship, I also didn't want to give them advice that would only cause further suffering. I considered breaking the unspoken rules and approaching the issue directly, giving them my unvarnished opinion, but I worried that doing so would simply provoke a reaction of outrage against me. But what right did I have think I knew what was best for them?</p>
        <br>
        <p>I chose to give the best advice I could to the questions they were brave enough to ask. Trying to steer them towards the questions that they wouldn't voice. Eventually I was asked by one of them if I thought they had a future. I told them that I thought they did, but it would require both of them to put in the work to grow past their issues, that they'd need to learn to compromise and communicate. They never asked what I thought those areas were.</p>
        <br>
        <p>They ended things soon after. Keeping both of them as friends has required some extra work on my part. It's been a rough experience for both of them. My personal hope is that they'll each take this experience and learn from it. Maybe down the track they'll be able to reconnect and get it right. Maybe they won't. Either way I'll try to help them as best I can, as best as they let me.</p>
        <h2 class="sect-title">The Influence of my Culture and Upbringing</h2>
        <p>My family moved country more than a few times when I was young, as a result I've never my identity has never been closely linked to any single country or place. Instead I formed my bonds and identity around my family. I have three brothers each quite different, and in addition across both sides of the extended family I have over two dozen cousins, each of which where a part of my life. Having such a large family gave me an appreciation for strong communities, group dynamics, and having an exposure to a diversity of experience.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My parents are also both individuals who have had to undergo a great deal of personal and emotional growth through out their lives. Having those experiences shared with me has helped foster a strong sense of self awareness and willingness to engage with my emotions and limitations with an intent to learn and change.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My family also has its fair share of highly educated individuals. As a result I was always encouraged to read and learn new things, to engage critically in discussion regardless of the topic. My grandfather had strong sense of social justice, having to fight against local authorities to educate the community on the dangers of asbestos, the need for vaccinations, and the many benefits of easy access to contraceptives. The lessons learned from these struggles were passed on to his sons and daughters, and through them to my generation and I.</p>

        <h2 class="sect-title">A Lesson on Conflict</h2>
        <p>I have always struggled in dealing with conflict. It's always been easier to let things go than have to deal with them, at least as a quick fix. This story is about when I truly learned that avoiding conflict is not a long term solution.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I had just moved into a new flat, some of the people I'd lived with before and was good friends with. Others were moving into the flat at the same time as I and were new to everyone and me. We all sat down on one of the first days to get to know eachother and share our expectations on sharing the space we'd all be living in. For the first six months it was one of the most positive flatting experiences I have ever had.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But over time cracks began to show. Two of the flatties, J & S, just didn't seem to get along, petty squables over shower time, or noise at night, or use of the washing machine. I didn't really know what was going on so I chose to stay out of it. Eventually S moved out, she left for another country. She'd be missed but at least that resolved the issue.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Then J started having issues with another flattie K. K began to talk to me about it feeling that the complaints were unreasonable. All that I suggested was that they try to work out a compromise, but K felt that wasn't going to happen. Eventually K moved out, she made it clear it was because of J.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now it was my turn. Previously I'd been on good terms with J, now I was finding my self the constatnt target of minor complaints. The smell of my cooking was too strong, I closed doors too loudly, I was making too much noise at night. I came to realise what I'd been ignoring, that J was a bully. I'd encountered bullies but I'd always dealt with them passively, easy enough to avoid or ignore them. But this was in my own home.</p>
        <br> 
        <p>I would acquiesce at first, doing my best to smooth over the ruffled feathers. But I found my self getting more and more worn down over time. This put a strain on my friendships with others in the flat who now had J talking about all the ways in which I was a terrible flatmate. I eventually found the courage to try and confront her directly, and called a flat meeting. But at that point the flat had become split on whose side they would take.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At that point I realised that there was no winning here, either way that flat I had grown to love and was fighting to stay in was already lost. I explained this to my friends still there even if they couldn't see it yet. I moved out and another 6 months later the while flat imploded.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even though I might not have "won the day" this was an important learning experience for me. I learned that bullies thrive when there is a lack of communication about their behaviour, that when you suspect people might be the victims of it that its best to get involved and bring it into the daylight. And if you can't change the elements that are turning an environment toxic, then the next best thing is to change your environment for a new one.</p>
