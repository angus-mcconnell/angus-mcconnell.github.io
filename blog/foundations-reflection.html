        <h2 class="sect-title">Three New Things I Have Learned About Myself</h2>
        <p>
          Going through the weekly core exercises has helped me to learn all sorts of new things about my self, but here are a few that stood out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am very uncomfortable talking about my self in objective terms. Part of this is because I am often doubtful about whether I can speak about my self in truthful terms. The easiest way for me to get past this is to engage in self deprecation, but then that's not very truthful is it. The other part of why I find this hard is becuase there's a part of me that doesn't like to nail down aspects of my self in concrete terms. There's something about it that I find almost frightening.
        </p>
        <p>
          The line between staying ontop of my workload like a boss and spiraling into a stress fueled cycle of isolation is atom thin. I've put a lot of work into staying ontop of this over foundations and it has paid dividends. But its still a part of my self that I do not trust. I think its just going to take more practice and gaining more confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest one that going through foundations and the core exercises is that I ahve learned just how capable of change I am. It's a huge boost to your confidence to know that who you are today doesn't have to be who you are tomorrow. Change doesn't happen over night, but with serious application of self it is possible. And it can happen quicker than you think.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sect-title">The Role of Values, Empathy, and Self Awareness in Learning and Programming</h2>
        <p>
          Being effective in learning and in programming requires a similar set of skills, this is probably because a big part of programming is being in a state of constant learning. And having a strong understanding of self, your values, having empathy for your self and others all works to foster the skills needed to excell in learning. Particularly in having a growth mindset, and being able to communicate and cooperate with others.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sect-title">The Most Surprising Thing About the Core Learning</h2>
        <p>
          How much of it was connected to the things I've already learned about in my own journey of personal growth as I endured an exteneded period of depression. Neuroplasticity, growth mindsets, emotional intelligence, these are all things I've had to work on myself before I joined the Dev Academy course. And seeing them all laid out and interconnected has helped me to see them in a much bigger picture than I had before.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sect-title">The Most Challenging Parts of the Core Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Definitely trying to be objective about myself. Due to my self deprecating and perfectionist nature it isn't easy for me to evaluate my strengths and weaknesses in a way that I feel is trustworthy. It often feels like trying to perform self administered dental surgery, awkward, painful, and time consuming.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sect-title">Why The Emphasis on Non-Programming Skills?</h2>
        <p>
          First because these are skills that are actively looked for on the tech industry. The understanding is that it is often harder to train people in the non-technical skills needed to be good team players than it is to train people in the technical skills that they need for the job role.

          Second its important that we learn these skills early on in course. This is because having a growth mind set, understanding how to communicate, and how to be epathic, will make our learning experience far more positive. Especially as our work becomes more focussed on working as part of a group.

          Lastly because it will help to just improve our personal lives in general.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sect-title">Is it Worth It?</h2>
        <p>
          Absolutely, no doubts on my part. Developing a better understanding of Neuroplasticity, Growth Mindsets, and Emotional Intelligence and their application has greatly enhanced my experience with the course already. With out these skills I would have had a harder time identifying and overcoming negative patterns of learning behaviour that would have only held me back.
