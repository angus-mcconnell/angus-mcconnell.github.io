        <h2 class="sect-title">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>First developed as a concept in the early 20th century, IQ (Intelligence Quotient) testing has since become a common and popular way to determine and validate an individuals mental capabilities.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However since its inception many scientists have questioned the validity of IQ testing. Particularly criticising it as only being a reliable measure of those aspects of intelligence suited to academic performance, when there are many other forms of intelligence that are ignored by such testing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a complimentary alternative to IQ the idea of EI (Emotional Intelligence) testing has been gaining popularity. EI is a way to gague an individuals adeptness in self awareness, social awareness, and communication skills. In fact many tech and business organisations are coming to recognise EQ as being more important to an individuals performance in a work environments than IQ.</p>

        <h2 class="sect-title">Why Emotional Intelligence is Importatnt</h2>
        <p>When it comes to solving analytical problems IQ is king. But these problems rarely exist in a vacum, and realistically we are rarely expected to be capable of solving them on our own. Instead these analytical problems exist in complex social spaces where cooperation with others is going to be key in creating effective solutions. What many organisations are beginning to recognise is that it is easier to train individuls in the technical skills needed to complete their tasks than it is to train them in the social skills to be an effective member of their team. They are also realising that individuals with low EI can negatively affect an entire teams performance.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Beyond this immediate benefit to aiding in the cooperative nature of work environments having a developed EI is also important in an individuals personal life. People with high EI are likely to be more satisified, have better personal relationships, and more motivated to improve their life. Having a high IQ can make you better at solving problems, but having a high can amke you a better person.</p>
